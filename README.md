# Grouper 

## Problem Statement: 
Virtual gatherings allow for no individual control over who you interact with. This leaves users trapped in a massive group chat or breakout rooms controlled only by the event administrator.

## Solution: 
Grouper seeks to enable you to have control over who you interact with and when. Control a virtual avatar that moves around a common space. When you move within a certain proximity of other users, a new Google Hangout is generated for everyone in the area to form a conversation group.

We see this application being very useful for online events such as parties, conferences and other social occasions.
